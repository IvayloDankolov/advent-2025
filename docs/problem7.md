# Day 7

Yay, first chance I've had this week to catch up and do 2 in a row, after wasting all of Monday with the execution boilerplate. Let's see what fortune has in store for us...

Cool, let's see if I'm Rust-y or rusty. I might be living on _borrowed_ time after that joke.

Yeah alright I'll show myself out.

Thankfully unlike Kotlin I use the toolchain for this a bit more regularly. On to the problem.

## First impressions

Ah yes, a classic recombobulator misalignment in the perihelic quantum transference coils. Let me grab my sonic screwdriver and it'll be a piece of cake.

I was wondering if we'd get to actual map/graph/labyrinth problems soon. Looks like we're about to hit the meatier stuff. Well, depending on what part 2 of this looks like.

The example reminds me of that lottery game where a ball randomly hits pegs on the way down and goes left or right.

The first part is pretty easily as a vector problem in exactly the same way the example shows. Let's do some mapping.

Did I auto pilot and read this as returning the total beams when you reach the bottom? Most definitely. Thankfully adding the splits as extra state wasn't the most difficult thing in the world

## Part two
