Well, given that our test runner is Typescript this won't be the most difficult thing in the world to set up. Probably best not to give it an unfair advantage by importing it inside the runner though.

OK never mind, type:module vs type:commonjs is such a damned pain in the ass. That was a pointless waste of 5 mins. Anyway, let's read the actual problem.

## First impressions

That's it I'm calling OSHA on this whole damned operation. How are there no emergency stairways for when the lifts are offline and breaking a wall with a forklift must violate at least a dozen workplace safety rules.

Alright I'm so going to abuse array out of bounds returning undefined here, perfect.
But also again, there isn't really much room for misinterpretation of this. You look at adjacent cells and count, and you load it up in a 2d array for constant time access. It's, uh, pretty cut and dry to be honest.

And the shiny star is ours. Let's see what the part 2 twist is.
