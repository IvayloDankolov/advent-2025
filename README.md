# Advent of code 2025

A small runner harness and solutions to the problems from Advent of Code 2025.

## What language is it in?

I figured let's make a lottery so each new day is a pleasant surprise. So by the completely fair and objective criteria of "whatever name came to mind next", we're going to draw from this list:

* C++
* Rust
* Haskell
* Python
* Typescript
* Java
* Clojure
* Swift
* Kotlin
* C#
* Go
* Lua

Also, apparently the most popular language according to Stack Overflow is Javascript again, and I'm not writing a test harness in that so we'll compromise with Typescript.

I'll add to each day's notes what ended up getting drawn.

## Why not post after Christmas

Honestly I'm not sure how religiously we'll follow the advent calendar, pun intended, so it will ultimately depend on free time. However, with no global leaderboard and everyone being a smartass and just brute forcing problems with LLM agents if you care at all about about this being a competition in any way, I'm sorry to say that it's dead.

Just have fun and do them at your own pace, and maybe don't search solutions on Github until you've had your fill and are ready to compare notes.
